# Roadmap

Development is tracked through [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fa-bridge/milestones),
one per phase. Each phase is an `epic`-labeled issue whose native sub-issues carry the work.
This document is the map; the tracker is the source of truth for status.

## Charter

**The working plugin is the primary output.** fa-bridge implements the fighters-legacy
engine's `IContentPack` and transcodes Jane's Fighters Anthology (1998) assets into the
engine's canonical open formats at load time. Reverse-engineering knowledge is *consumed*
from [fighters-codex](https://github.com/jomkz/fighters-codex) — via its docs and the
`fx_lib` submodule — and never produced here: when bridging exposes a format gap, it
becomes a fighters-codex issue, not local RE.

## The 1.0 definition

v1.0.0 ships when, and only when:

1. **Every category in [asset-support-matrix.md](asset-support-matrix.md) is bridged**,
   or carries a written rationale (no engine target / upstream-blocked with issue link /
   out of scope).
2. **A stock FA install loads end-to-end** on Linux and Windows: flyable aircraft with
   textures and sound; missions playable via the engine's mission runtime.
3. **Every transcoder has tests and synthetic fixtures** (no FA assets committed) and its
   output passes engine `AssetValidator` conformance.
4. **License and distribution positioning is resolved** and documented
   ([#37](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fa-bridge/issues/37)).
5. Pins (`extern/fx_lib`, engine interface headers) are current and documented; releases
   current; the project then enters maintenance mode.

## Phases

Phases are **gated by ordering constraints, not dates**.

```
P0 ─→ P1 ─→ P2 ─→ P3 ─→ P4 ──────────────→ P6 (1.0)
             ▲          ▲                   ▲
 codex P1 ───┘          │                   │
 (fx_lib on Linux)      │                   │
 engine glTF materials ─┘ (textured accept) │
                        P5 ─────────────────┘
                         ▲
   codex mission object-list + engine mission runtime + codex T2 heightmaps

P1 may start any time after P0 — it needs no fx_lib (vendored engine headers only).
The license decision (#37) is owner-external — must resolve before P4's public release.

## What is unblocked today

- All of **Phase 1** — the skeleton compiles against vendored engine headers, no fx_lib.
- The fx_lib-free slices of **Phase 3**: transcoder design docs, the PT→FlightModel-TOML
  field-mapping document (against the engine's `docs/modding/flight-model.md`), synthetic
  test fixtures, and vendoring the write-side libraries below.

## Platform notes

- **macOS gap upstream:** fighters-codex Phase 1's exit gate covers Linux (GCC/Clang) and
  Windows (MSVC) only; this repo's rule is all three platforms including AppleClang.
  Tracked upstream as [codex#155](https://github.com/jomkz/fighters-codex/issues/155),
  with this repo's 3-OS CI as the proving ground once `FA_WITH_FX_LIB` flips ON.
- **Plugin ABI discipline:** `std::optional`/`std::string`/`std::vector` cross the plugin
  boundary, so the plugin must be built with the same toolchain family and CRT
  configuration as the engine (MSVC: matching `/MD` and iterator-debug-level; Linux:
  libstdc++ vs libc++). The factory symbol needs `__declspec(dllexport)` under MSVC.
  See [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Bridge-owned transcoding and third-party dependencies

The engine accepts only canonical open formats, so this repository uniquely owns the
write side. Dependency decisions (RFC-visible per [GOVERNANCE.md](../GOVERNANCE.md)
"major new dependencies"):

| Transcode | Dependency | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| ShMesh → glTF `.glb` | **cgltf + cgltf_write** (MIT, single-header C) | GLB write support; tinygltf rejected as heavier (drags json.hpp + stb) |
| RGBA8 → PNG | **stb_image_write.h** (public domain) | Single header; KTX2/libktx deferred ([#41](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fa-bridge/issues/41)) |
| PCM → OGG Vorbis | **libogg + libvorbis/vorbisenc** (BSD-3) | The validator requires `OggS` and no credible single-header *encoder* exists; verify minivorbis first ([#40](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fa-bridge/issues/40)) |
| FlightModel/EntityDef TOML | hand-rolled emitter | Fixed output shape; ~100 lines; no dependency |
| Mission YAML | hand-rolled emitter | Blocked until Phase 5 anyway |

Vendoring layout (Phase 3): single headers under `transcode/vendor/` with REUSE
annotations; libogg/libvorbis under `extern/`.

## Relationship to fighters-codex and fighters-legacy

- **fighters-codex** (MIT) owns all FA reverse engineering; this repo consumes `fx_lib`
  as the `extern/fx_lib` submodule, pinned to a release tag. After each codex release the
  pin is bumped (their release script prints the reminder; dependabot watches the
  submodule). Format gaps found here are filed there.
- **fighters-legacy** (GPL) owns `IContentPack` — the interface source of truth. The
  three interface headers are vendored with a recorded pin (Phase 1) because the engine
  exports no CMake package; the interface may still gain pure virtuals, so the pin is
  load-bearing and bumped deliberately.
- **License boundary and the open question:** fighters-codex is MIT; one-way consumption
  into this GPL repo is fine, and code is never transcribed against that boundary. This
  repository is **GPL-3.0-or-later today** — but the engine's distribution docs have
  positioned fa-bridge as a paid, non-GPL plugin (possible via `IContentPack.h`'s GPL
  linking exception). That decision is deliberately open, tracked in
  [#37](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fa-bridge/issues/37) (and
  [engine#657](https://github.com/fighters-legacy/fighters-legacy/issues/657)); it gates
  Phase 4's public release. If the proprietary branch is ever chosen, relicensing must
  happen **before** any external DCO-signed contribution is accepted.

## Releases

Minimum one release per phase gate: v0.1.0 (P0) · v0.2.0 (P1) · v0.3.0 (P2) ·
v0.4.0 (P3) · v0.5.0 (P4) · v0.6+ (P5) · **v1.0.0** (P6).

## How this roadmap is maintained

- Phases are milestones; epics are `epic`-labeled issues; work items are native
  sub-issues. New work lands as a sub-issue of the epic it serves.
- [asset-support-matrix.md](asset-support-matrix.md) is updated in the same PR as the
  change it reflects (the docs-currency rule in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)).
- No standalone TODO files — if it's worth doing, it's an issue.
